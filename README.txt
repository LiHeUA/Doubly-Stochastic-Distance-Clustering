This set of m-files demonstrates how the Doubly Stochastic Distance Clustering algorithm works in principle. 

To run the demo, simply start Matlab and run demo.m. 

The algorithm described in the code is published in: 

Li He and Hong Zhang, "Doubly Stochastic Distance Clustering", to appear in TCSVT.
